A quick and easy way to embed 24/7 medical marijuana and hemp radio from the Time4Hemp Global Broadcasting Network into your WordPress blog.


== Description ==

The Medical Marijuana Radio by Time4Hemp plugin is an easy way to embed a Spreaker audio player that plays medical marijuana and hemp-related programming from the [Time4Hemp Global Broadcasting Network](https://time4hemp.com) in your Wordress sidebar. This plugin is a modified version of the [Spreaker Shortcode plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/spreaker-shortcode/), and modifies the original plugin to add styling and station settings specific to this station.

Example Usage:

`[medical-marijuana-radio]`


**More Options**

Medical Marijuana Radio by Time4Hemp supports these optional parameters:

* `type`: `standard` or `mini` (defaults to `mini`)
* `autoplay`: if `true` the player will automatically start playing (defaults to `false`)
* `debug`: if `true` will print some debug information, which is useful if the player renders differently than expected (defaults to `false`)

**User Customization**

The Medical Marijuana Radio administrative menu link gives an option for the administrator to include custom css that will affect the front-end display for the plugin.
